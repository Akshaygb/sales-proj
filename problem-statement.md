🎶 Project: "Music Instrument Rental Tracker – Borrow & Return System"

📌 Industry: Music / Rentals
📌 Project Type: Simple Record Management CRM
📌 Target Users: Store Manager, Students/Musicians

✅ Problem Statement

A music academy/shop rents out instruments (guitar, keyboard, violin, drums) to students. Currently, rentals are tracked in notebooks, which causes issues in checking availability, overdue returns, and lost items.

Salesforce CRM will be implemented to:
Manage instrument inventory (name, type, availability)
Record borrow/return history of instruments
Send reminders before return date
Provide dashboards of most-rented instruments

🧠 Use Cases

    Add and update instrument details with availability status

Rental Tracking:
    Record borrow date & return date
    Auto-update instrument availability after return

Customer/Student Management:
    Maintain student/musician rental history

Notifications:
    Email reminder for return deadline

Reporting:
    Dashboard showing “Instruments Rented This Month” and “Most Popular Instruments”
